This is a personal copy of [Learn Unity Beginner/Intermediate 2023 (FREE COMPLETE Course - Unity Tutorial)](https://youtu.be/AmGSEH7QcDg).
Codes are slightly different, because I try to follow my own developing practice.

I'm now going through parts `Selected Counter Visual, Singleton Pattern`, so not a finished project yet.

Notes are about to add after I gain enough things & overview to help me conclude my learn.

## Script Editing

This project is supposed to be completely Rider friendly,
You should see very few warnings if you use Rider for script editing.

## Learning Suggestions

I'm learning this project with these following steps:

1. I watch several parts of the lesson video
   and gain overview of the next steps.
2. I have a full reference project from Code Monkey's website
   in case I have some confusing when I'm operating myself.
3. I gain notes after I finish all these parts I gained previously.
   (you can get all these note in [Docs folder](Assets/Docs))

Now for you, you can combine the 2 & 3 step together with this repository
for it's cleaner 
and I also accept many better code styles given from Rider and Copilot.
But all is up to you, if you thing the raw project is more completed or so on.
